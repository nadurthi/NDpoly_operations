Multivariate Polynomial operations: Add, substract, multiply, integrate, differentiate in matlab

Multivariate polynomials have several applications in 
- interpolation
- approximations
- Automatic Control
- Machine learning
- probability density estimation 
- And general estimation and control


- Create multi-dimensional or multivariate polynomials
- Perform addition, substraction, division, derivatives and integrals of these multi variate polynomials
